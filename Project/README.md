# Ale Analysis: Unearthing the Bitter Truth of Beer Bias and the Quest for Objectivity

## Abstract
> A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
Embark on a frothy journey as we delve into the world of beer reviews, unearthing patterns and insights that lie beneath the surface. This project aims to tap into the keg of beer ratings, exploring the influence of personal biases and geographical loyalties. We aim to distill the essence of beer ratings, separating the heady influence of a reviewer’s inherent “niceness” from their sober assessment. We also seek to uncover whether patriotism intoxicates our taste buds, influencing users to rate their home brews higher. Our motivation is to pour clarity into the pint of beer ratings, understanding how personal and geographical factors can add unique flavors to our perception of taste. Join us as we raise a toast to data, and discover the story each beer review has to tell. Let’s embark on this hop-filled journey to decode the ale-chemy of beer ratings!

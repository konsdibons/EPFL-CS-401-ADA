# Ale Analysis: Unearthing the Bitter Truth of Beer Bias and the Quest for Objectivity

## Abstract
> A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

Embark on a frothy journey as we delve into the world of beer reviews, unearthing patterns and insights that lie beneath the surface. This project aims to tap into the keg of beer ratings, exploring the influence of personal biases and geographical loyalties. We aim to distill the essence of beer ratings, separating the heady influence of a reviewer’s inherent “niceness” from their sober assessment. We also seek to uncover whether patriotism intoxicates our taste buds, influencing users to rate their home brews higher. Our motivation is to pour clarity into the pint of beer ratings, understanding how personal and geographical factors can add unique flavors to our perception of taste. Join us as we raise a toast to data, and discover the story each beer review has to tell. Let’s embark on this hop-filled journey to decode the ale-chemy of beer ratings!

## Research questions
> A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

### Question 1: Some People Are Just Too Nice
Can we identify patterns in beer ratings based on the reviewer’s behavior and their inherent “niceness”? Specifically, we aim to investigate:

1. Do seasoned beer reviewers have clear patterns in their ratings, and can we distinguish between those who consistently rate high, those who consistently rate low, and those who never rate below a certain threshold (e.g., 3/5)?
2. Can we decorrelate a reviewer’s “niceness” from their beer ratings, based on their ratings’ standard deviation and the free-form text in their reviews?
3. Can we develop a method to combine the standard deviation of ratings and the sentiment of review text to produce “objective” ratings that account for a user’s past rating behavior?
This research question aims to delve into the subjective nature of beer reviews and explore the possibility of deriving more objective measures of beer quality. It also seeks to understand the influence of individual reviewer behavior on beer ratings.

### Question 2: Geographic beer bias: focus on the raters
Is the concept of a "beer nation" more than just a label? How are nations perceived in the field of beer? Are these perceptions based on reality or are they just empty words? Specifically, we aim to investigate:

1. Can we evaluate the average beer ratings of different countries and determine if there are noticeable differences?
2. Do the sources of these ratings (domestic or international users) influence the average rating of a country's beer?
3. Do users show a preference for beers from their home country, indicating the influence of national pride on beer ratings? Are there differences between countries in this respect?

This research question aims to uncover the truth behind the label of "beer nation" and explore the influence of national pride and perception on beer ratings. It also seeks to understand the global landscape of beer appreciation and how it is shaped by national identities.

### Question 3: Brewing Preferences: A Linguistic and Quantitative Analysis of Beer Ratings
Does the number of breweries and variety of beer types produced by a nation influence the overall rating of its beers? Specifically, we aim to investigate:

1. Is there a correlation between the number of breweries in a country, the variety of beer types it produces, and the overall rating of its beers?
2. Can we gain a more detailed understanding of how nations are rated on sub-ratings such as taste and appearance?
3. Can we use natural language processing techniques to analyze the textual reviews of beers from different countries and identify linguistic patterns that reflect the preferences and characteristics of those countries' brewers?
4. Can we examine the taste preferences of users from each country and identify regional inclinations by weighing the description of the beers reviewed against their ratings?

This research question aims to delve deeper into the factors that influence beer ratings and explore the potential impact of a country's brewing industry and cultural preferences on the perception of its beers. It also seeks to add a linguistic dimension to the analysis, using natural language processing techniques to uncover insights from the textual reviews of beers.
